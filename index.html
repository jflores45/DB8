      The popular American card game Uno has simple rules, right?<br> WRONG! <br> Here are some rules you're probably playing incorrectly.
    </div>
    <div class="box red">
      <h2>Red</h2>
      If you don't have a card to play, you only have to pick up one card. You don't have to keep drawing cards until you get one that matches the discard pile, and you can even play it right away!
    </div>
    <div class="box blue">
      <h2>Blue</h2>
      You can't stack or chain cards. Sorry, you can't make your little brother pick up 6 cards by playing a draw 2 after a draw 4. If a draw card is played, the next player picks up the cards and misses their turn.
    </div>
    <div class="box yellow">
      <h2>Yellow</h2>
      You can win with an action card. Wild, Skip, even Reverse - doesn't matter as long as it matches the color!
    </div>
    <div class="box green">
      <h2>Green</h2>
      You can win with an action card. The other player's turn is skipped, and you can play again right away. Same with draw cards!
